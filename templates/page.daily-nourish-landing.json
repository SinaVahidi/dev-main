        "reason-title-1": "Plant Based Iron",
        "reason-text-1": "Surpassing all other superfood mixes and greens powders currently available, Daily Nourish includes a synergistic mix of plant-based greens, supplying 22 mg of bioavailable iron per serving. This is thanks to the star ingredient, organic curry leaf! Iron supplements that come in capsule or pill form can be difficult to absorb and hard on the stomach, resulting in low compliance. The good news? It’s easier than ever to meet your daily iron intake with Daily Nourish superfood mix.",

        "reason-text-2": "Your time is just as valuable as your health! No one has the time (or pantry space) to measure out and add over10 separate superfood ingredients to your daily smoothie. Instead, we’ve combined 13 of the world’s best superfoods into one simple mix. Best of all, each ingredient is optimized for the best serving size. Not sure how much flaxseed, maca, camu camu, hemp hearts, bee pollen, or moringa to add to your smoothie? No problem - we’ve got it covered for you in one simple scoop.",

With 11 g of plant-based protein per serving and 7 g of heart-healthy fats. Daily Nourish boosts energy and vitality, healthy digestion, immunity, heart health and cognitive health. This all in one mix is anti-inflammatory, rich in antioxidants, and can help to regular blood sugar balance. Simplify your pantry + medicine cabinet with this nutrient dense superfood mix.",

These plant based superfoods contain numerous phytochemicals that act as antioxidants including polyphenols, flavanols, anthocyanin, catechin, and more! Antioxidants are a key component for longevity and health - helping the body to fight oxidative stress and neutralize free radicals. BONUS: Vitamin C aids the absorption of iron, making this an ideal pairing with the organic curry leaf.",
